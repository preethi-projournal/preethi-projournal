<h1>Documentation</h1>
In this API we did the CURD operations using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE with the help of Express.

Express.js is a small framework that works on top of Node.js web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your applicationâ€™s functionality with middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.
